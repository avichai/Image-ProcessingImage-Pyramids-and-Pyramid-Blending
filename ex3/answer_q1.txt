Q1:

If we multiply with different coefficient is means that we multiply
that we multiply the different laplacian with some value.

As learned in class the laplacian in each level represent different
frequencies. Therefore when we multiply with some coefficient
and than adding the result to reconstruct the image we are actually
amplifying or de amplifying certain frequencies of the image.

Only when we are using all 1's coefficient we are using the same
frequencies as the original image has.
