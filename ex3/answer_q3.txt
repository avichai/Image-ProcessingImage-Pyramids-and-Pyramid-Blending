Q3:

The max_levels parameter is used to determine how many
levels there will be at each pyramid (at most if possible).

Therefore using larger max_level will create larger pyramids
which mean the blending will be done in more levels.

We can expect better results of blending when using more levels
(In the aspect of blending of the connection points between the 2 images).
