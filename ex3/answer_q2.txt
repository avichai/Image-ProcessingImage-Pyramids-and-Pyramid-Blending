Q2:

The filter size is using for the kernel that will
be used when performing the blurring of the images.

Therefore using different kernel size will create
different blurring of the images and therefore will change
the blending of the image.

For instance if we use a small kernel size (e.g. 3), there will
not be a lot of blurring and therefore there will be add a lot
of noise to the pyramids and eventually to the blend image.

On the other end if we use a really large kernel (e.g. 101),
The blur will not be locally and therefore we will lose
some of the details of the images (the high frequencies for
instance).
